    <strong><a>Michelangelo Short Bio</a></strong>
    <br>
    <p>Graphic arts
        A number of Michelangelo's works of painting, sculpture and architecture rank among the most famous in
        existence.[2]
        His output in these fields was prodigious; given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence, sketches and
        reminiscences,
        he is the best-documented artist of the 16th century. He sculpted two of his best-known works, the Pietà and
        David,
        before the age of thirty. Despite holding a low opinion of painting, he also created two of the most influential
        frescoes in the history of Western art: the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome,
        and The Last Judgment on its altar wall. His design of the Laurentian Library pioneered Mannerist architecture.
        [5] At the age of 74, he succeeded Antonio da Sangallo the Younger as the architect of St. Peter's Basilica.
        He transformed the plan so that the western end was finished to his design, as was the dome, with some
        modification, after his death.

        Michelangelo was the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive.[2] In fact,
        two biographies were published during his lifetime. One of them, by Giorgio Vasari, proposed that Michelangelo's
        work transcended that of any artist living or dead, and was "supreme in not one art alone but in all three".[6]

        In his lifetime, Michelangelo was often called Il Divino ("the divine one").[7]
        His contemporaries often admired his terribilità—his ability to instil a sense of awe.
        Attempts by subsequent artists to imitate[8] Michelangelo's impassioned, highly personal
        style resulted in Mannerism, the next major movement in Western art after the High Renaissance.</p>
